An efficient pure Python implementation of the Apriori algorithm. Works with Python 3.6+.

The apriori algorithm uncovers hidden structures in categorical data.
The classical example is a database containing purchases from a supermarket.
Every purchase has a number of items associated with it.
We would like to uncover association rules such as `{bread, eggs} -> {bacon}` from the data.
This is the goal of [association rule learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning), and the [Apriori algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm) is arguably the most famous algorithm for this problem.
This repository contains an efficient, well-tested implementation of the apriori algorithm as described in the [original paper](https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~dwcorne/Teaching/agrawal94fast.pdf) by Agrawal et al, published in 1994.

**The code is stable and in widespread use.** It's cited in the book "*Mastering Machine Learning Algorithms*" by Bonaccorso.

**The code is fast.** See timings in [this PR](https://github.com/tommyod/Efficient-Apriori/pull/40).


## Example

Here's a minimal working example.
Notice that in every transaction with `eggs` present, `bacon` is present too.
Therefore, the rule `{eggs} -> {bacon}` is returned with 100 % confidence.

```python
from efficient_apriori import apriori
transactions = [('eggs', 'bacon', 'soup'),
                ('eggs', 'bacon', 'apple'),
                ('soup', 'bacon', 'banana')]
itemsets, rules = apriori(transactions, min_support=0.5, min_confidence=1)
print(rules)  # [{eggs} -> {bacon}, {soup} -> {bacon}]
```
If your data is in a pandas DataFrame, you must [convert it to a list of tuples](https://github.com/tommyod/Efficient-Apriori/issues/12).
Do you have **missing values**, or does the algorithm **run for a long time**? See [this comment](https://github.com/tommyod/Efficient-Apriori/issues/30#issuecomment-626129085).
**More examples are included below.**

## Installation

The software is available through GitHub, and through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/efficient-apriori/).
You may install the software using `pip`.

### Filtering and sorting association rules

It's possible to filter and sort the returned list of association rules.

```python
from efficient_apriori import apriori
transactions = [('eggs', 'bacon', 'soup'),
                ('eggs', 'bacon', 'apple'),
                ('soup', 'bacon', 'banana')]
itemsets, rules = apriori(transactions, min_support=0.2, min_confidence=1)

# Print out every rule with 2 items on the left hand side,
# 1 item on the right hand side, sorted by lift
rules_rhs = filter(lambda rule: len(rule.lhs) == 2 and len(rule.rhs) == 1, rules)
for rule in sorted(rules_rhs, key=lambda rule: rule.lift):
  print(rule)  # Prints the rule and its confidence, support, lift, ...
```

### Transactions with IDs

If you need to know which transactions occurred in the frequent itemsets, set the `output_transaction_ids` parameter to `True`.
This changes the output to contain `ItemsetCount` objects for each itemset.
The objects have a `members` property containing is the set of ids of frequent transactions as well as a `count` property. 
The ids are the enumeration of the transactions in the order they appear.    

```python
from efficient_apriori import apriori
transactions = [('eggs', 'bacon', 'soup'),
                ('eggs', 'bacon', 'apple'),
                ('soup', 'bacon', 'banana')]
itemsets, rules = apriori(transactions, output_transaction_ids=True)
print(itemsets)
# {1: {('bacon',): ItemsetCount(itemset_count=3, members={0, 1, 2}), ...
```
