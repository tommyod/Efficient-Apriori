Efficient-Apriori
=================

An efficient pure Python implementation of the Apriori algorithm.

Overview
--------

An efficient pure Python implementation of the Apriori algorithm.
Created for Python 3.6 and 3.7.

The apriori algorithm uncovers hidden structures in categorical data.
The classical example is a database containing purchases from a supermarket.
Every purchase has a number of items associated with it.
We would like to uncover association rules such as `{bread, eggs} -> {bacon}`
from the data. This is the goal of `association rule
learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning>`_, and the
`Apriori algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm>`_ is
arguably the most famous algorithm for this problem. This project contains an
efficient, well-tested implementation of the apriori algorithm as descriped in
the  `original paper <https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~dwcorne/Teaching/agrawal94fast.pdf>`_
by Agrawal et al, published in 1994.

Installation
------------

The package is distributed on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/efficient-apriori/>`_.
From your terminal, simply run the following command to install the package.

::

    $ pip install efficient-apriori

Notice that the name of the package is ``efficient-apriori`` on PyPI, while it's
imported as ``import efficient_apriori``.

A minimal working example
-------------------------

.. py:currentmodule:: efficient_apriori

Here's a minimal working example.
Notice that in every transaction with `eggs` present, `bacon` is present too.
Therefore, the rule `{eggs} -> {bacon}` is returned with 100 % confidence.

.. code-block:: python

    from efficient_apriori import apriori
    transactions = [('eggs', 'bacon', 'soup'),
                    ('eggs', 'bacon', 'apple'),
                    ('soup', 'bacon', 'banana')]
    itemsets, rules = apriori(transactions, min_support=0.5,  min_confidence=1)
    print(rules)  # [{eggs} -> {bacon}, {soup} -> {bacon}]

See the API documentation for the full signature of :func:`~efficient_apriori.apriori`.
More examples are included below.

Filtering and sorting association rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's possible to filter and sort the returned list of association rules.

.. code-block:: python

    from efficient_apriori import apriori
    transactions = [('eggs', 'bacon', 'soup'),
                    ('eggs', 'bacon', 'apple'),
                    ('soup', 'bacon', 'banana')]
    itemsets, rules = apriori(transactions, min_support=0.2,  min_confidence=1)

    # Print out every rule with 2 items on the left hand side,
    # 1 item on the right hand side, sorted by lift
    rules_rhs = filter(lambda rule: len(rule.lhs) == 2 and len(rule.rhs) == 1, rules)
    for rule in sorted(rules_rhs, key=lambda rule: rule.lift):
      print(rule) # Prints the rule and its confidence, support, lift, ...

suggestions for improvements. Your submitted code must be PEP8 compliant, and
all tests must pass.

API documentation
-----------------

Although the Apriori algorithm uses many sub-functions, only three functions
are likely of interest to the reader. The :func:`~efficient_apriori.apriori`
returns both the itemsets and the association rules, which is obtained by calling
:func:`~efficient_apriori.itemsets_from_transactions`
and
:func:`~efficient_apriori.generate_rules_apriori`, respectively.
The rules are returned as instances of the :class:`~efficient_apriori.Rule` class,
so reading up on it's basic methods might be useful.
