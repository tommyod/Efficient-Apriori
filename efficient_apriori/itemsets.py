    Join k length itemsets into k + 1 length itemsets.

    This algorithm assumes that the list of itemsets are sorted, and that the
    itemsets themselves are sorted tuples. Instead of always enumerating all
    n^2 combinations, the algorithm only has n^2 runtime for each block of
    itemsets with the first k - 1 items equal.
