    Bottom up algorithm for generating association rules from itemsets, very
    similar to the fast algorithm proposed in the original 1994 paper by

    The algorithm is based on the observation that for {a, b} -> {c, d} to
    hold, both {a, b, c} -> {d} and {a, b, d} -> {c} must hold, since in
    general conf( {a, b, c} -> {d} ) >= conf( {a, b} -> {c, d} ).

    there is no need to ever consider the two-consequent rule.

    ----------

        sets). The second level is of the form (itemset, count_in_dataset)).
